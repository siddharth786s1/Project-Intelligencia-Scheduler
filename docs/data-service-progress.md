# Data Service Implementation Progress

## Overview
We've made significant progress on the Data Service implementation, focusing on building a robust foundation for managing educational data entities. This service is crucial for storing and retrieving institutional hierarchy information that will be used by the Scheduler Service.

## Completed Components

### Base Repository Pattern
- Implemented a generic repository pattern with type safety
- Added multi-tenant isolation at the repository level
- Implemented common CRUD operations with proper error handling
- Added support for filtering and detailed queries with joins

### Models
- Created SQLAlchemy models for:
  - Institutions
  - Departments
  - Classrooms
  - Room Types
  - Subjects
  - Batches
- Defined relationships between models
- Added proper indexing for efficient queries
- Implemented many-to-many relationships for batch-subject associations

### Schemas
- Implemented Pydantic schemas for request/response validation
- Created separate schemas for creation, update, and response
- Added proper validation rules
- Implemented detailed response schemas with relationships

### API Endpoints
- Implemented REST endpoints for all entities:
  - GET /institutions/ - List all institutions
  - POST /institutions/ - Create a new institution
  - GET /institutions/{id} - Get institution details
  - PATCH /institutions/{id} - Update an institution
  - DELETE /institutions/{id} - Delete an institution
  - Similar endpoints for departments, classrooms, room types, subjects, and batches
- Added proper error handling
- Implemented pagination for list endpoints
- Added filtering by department for subjects and batches
- Implemented subject-batch association endpoints

### Security
- Integrated with IAM service for JWT validation
- Implemented role-based access control
- Applied tenant isolation for all data operations
- Enforced proper authorization for cross-entity operations

## Next Steps
1. Implement remaining entities:
   - Faculty members
   - Teaching preferences
   - Time slots
   - Scheduling constraints
2. Add comprehensive test coverage
3. Optimize database queries
4. Add caching for frequently accessed data
5. Create API documentation with Swagger UI
