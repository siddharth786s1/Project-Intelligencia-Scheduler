# Data Service Implementation Progress

## Overview

We've made significant progress on the Data Service implementation, focusing on building a robust foundation for managing educational data entities. This service is crucial for storing and retrieving institutional hierarchy information that will be used by the Scheduler Service.

## Completed Components

### Base Repository Pattern

- Implemented a generic repository pattern with type safety
- Added multi-tenant isolation at the repository level
- Implemented common CRUD operations with proper error handling
- Added support for filtering and detailed queries with joins

### Models

- Created SQLAlchemy models for:
  - Institutions
  - Departments
  - Classrooms
  - Room Types
  - Subjects
  - Batches
  - Faculty
  - Faculty Preferences (Availability, Subject Expertise, Teaching Preferences)
  - Time Slots
  - Scheduling Constraints
  - Scheduled Sessions
- Defined relationships between models
- Added proper indexing for efficient queries
- Implemented many-to-many relationships for batch-subject associations

### Schemas

- Implemented Pydantic schemas for request/response validation
- Created separate schemas for creation, update, and response
- Added proper validation rules
- Implemented detailed response schemas with relationships
- Added enum support for preference types and expertise levels

### API Endpoints

- Implemented REST endpoints for all entities:
  - GET /institutions/ - List all institutions
  - POST /institutions/ - Create a new institution
  - GET /institutions/{id} - Get institution details
  - PATCH /institutions/{id} - Update an institution
  - DELETE /institutions/{id} - Delete an institution
  - Similar endpoints for departments, classrooms, room types, subjects, batches
  - Faculty management endpoints:
    - Basic faculty CRUD operations
    - Faculty availability management
    - Subject expertise management
    - Teaching preferences (batch, classroom)
- Added proper error handling
- Implemented pagination for list endpoints
- Added filtering by department for subjects, batches, and faculty
- Implemented subject-batch association endpoints
- Implemented combined faculty preferences view

### Security

- Integrated with IAM service for JWT validation
- Implemented role-based access control
- Applied tenant isolation for all data operations
- Enforced proper authorization for cross-entity operations

### Repositories

- Implemented specialized repositories for:
  - Base CRUD operations
  - Institution management
  - Department management
  - Classroom and Room Type management
  - Subject and Batch management
  - Faculty and Faculty Preferences management
  - Time Slot management
  - Scheduling Constraints management
  - Scheduled Sessions management with timetable views

## Next Steps

1. Connect Faculty with IAM user accounts
2. Add comprehensive test coverage for all repositories
3. Optimize database queries for complex scheduling operations
4. Add caching for frequently accessed timetable data
5. Enhance API documentation with Swagger UI
6. Implement bulk operations for scheduling constraints
7. Create dashboard views for faculty workload and scheduling metrics
