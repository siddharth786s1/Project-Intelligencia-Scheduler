## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining test coverage:
   - Write unit tests for SchedulerMonitor and Dashboard components
   - Complete comprehensive test suite for Data Service
   - Create integration test scripts for cross-service communication

2. Set up automated testing pipeline:
   - Configure CI/CD for automated test runs
   - Implement test coverage reporting
   - Set up performance benchmarking

3. Perform user acceptance testing:
   - Create UAT scenarios and scripts
   - Conduct user testing sessions
   - Document and prioritize feedback

4. Finalize documentation:
   - Complete user and administrator guides
   - Create comprehensive deployment documentation
   - Document common troubleshooting procedures

5. Prepare for deployment:
   - Optimize Docker configurations for production
   - Implement monitoring and logging infrastructure
   - Create backup and recovery procedures
