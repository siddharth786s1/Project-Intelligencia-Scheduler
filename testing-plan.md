# Comprehensive Testing and Integration Plan

This document outlines the testing and integration strategy for the Project Intelligencia Scheduler application, including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and performance tests.

## Testing Scope

### Components to be Tested

- IAM Service
- Data Service
- Scheduler Service
- Frontend Components
- System Integration

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

- Test individual components in isolation
- Focus on correct behavior of individual functions
- Mock dependencies to isolate functionality

### Integration Tests

- Test interactions between components
- Verify data flow between services
- Ensure API contracts are honored

### End-to-End Tests

- Simulate full user workflows
- Test complete system functionality
- Validate user experience

### Performance Tests

- Load testing under various conditions
- Stress testing of critical components
- Benchmark response times and resource usage

## Detailed Test Plan

1. **Unit Tests for Frontend Components**
   - Test SchedulerMonitor component
   - Test Dashboard integration
   - Test TimetableGenerator workflows
   - Test approval state transitions

2. **API Integration Tests**
   - Test frontend to API communication
   - Verify API response handling
   - Test error scenarios and recovery

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Complete user journey testing
   - Multi-tenant scenario testing
   - Cross-browser compatibility

4. **Performance and Load Testing**
   - Test concurrent job submissions
   - Measure algorithm performance under load
   - Verify system stability

## Implementation Schedule

Phase 1: Complete unit tests for all components (1 week)
Phase 2: Implement integration tests between services (1 week)
Phase 3: Create end-to-end test scenarios and scripts (1 week)
Phase 4: Conduct performance and load testing (1 week)
