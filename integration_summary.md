# Frontend-Scheduler Service Integration

This PR adds tools and documentation for testing the integration between the frontend and the scheduler service. This is a critical part of the application that enables users to generate, view, and manage timetables.

## Files Added

1. **Test Plan (`test_plan.md`)**
   - Comprehensive test scenarios covering all aspects of integration
   - Structured approach for validating functionality
   - Guidelines for test data setup

2. **Integration Test Setup Script (`setup_integration_test.sh`)**
   - Automated script for setting up test environment
   - Creates test data including institution, departments, batches, etc.
   - Configures the system for testing

3. **Integration Test Start Script (`start_integration_test.sh`)**
   - Script to start only the necessary components for testing
   - Runs frontend in development mode for easier debugging
   - Sets up proper environment variables

4. **Integration Checklist (`integration_checklist.md`)**
   - Detailed checklist of features to test
   - Covers UI components, API connections, and error handling
   - Tracking tool for test progress

5. **Scheduler Service Analysis (`scheduler_service_analysis.md`)**
   - Review of current implementation status
   - Analysis of integration points
   - Recommendations for improvements

## Key Integration Points

The integration between the frontend and scheduler service involves:

1. **API Communication**:
   - Job submission from TimetableGenerator component
   - Job status polling
   - Timetable retrieval for viewing

2. **Authentication Handling**:
   - Token forwarding between services
   - Permission validation

3. **Data Flow**:
   - Schedule generation parameters from UI to API
   - Generated timetable data from API to UI
   - Error messages and status updates

## Testing Approach

The testing approach focuses on:

1. **Functionality Testing**:
   - Verify all user flows work as expected
   - Ensure data is correctly displayed

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test communication between services
   - Verify data integrity between frontend and backend

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Ensure graceful degradation

## How to Use

1. **Setup Test Environment**:
   ```bash
   ./setup_integration_test.sh
   ```

2. **Start Components for Testing**:
   ```bash
   ./start_integration_test.sh
   ```

3. **Execute Test Plan**:
   Follow the test scenarios outlined in `test_plan.md` and track progress using the `integration_checklist.md`.

4. **Analyze Results**:
   Document any issues found during testing and prioritize fixes based on severity.

## Next Steps

1. Fix any issues found during testing
2. Consider implementing the improvements suggested in the analysis document
3. Complete the remaining frontend components
4. Prepare for production deployment
