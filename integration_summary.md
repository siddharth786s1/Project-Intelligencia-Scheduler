   - Dashboard integration with real-time monitoring (`frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)
   - Documentation of the monitoring system (`docs/scheduler-monitoring.md`)

## Key Integration Points

The integration between the frontend and scheduler service involves:

1. **API Communication**:
   - Job submission from TimetableGenerator component
   - Job status polling
   - Timetable retrieval for viewing
   - Timetable status management via ApprovalWorkflow
   - Scheduler system monitoring and metrics collection

2. **Authentication Handling**:
   - Token forwarding between services
   - Permission validation
   - Role-based access control for timetable approval workflow

3. **Data Flow**:
   - Schedule generation parameters from UI to API
   - Generated timetable data from API to UI
   - Error messages and status updates
   - Timetable status transitions and approval workflow data
   - Scheduler job status and system metrics

## Testing Approach

The testing approach focuses on:

1. **Functionality Testing**:
   - Verify all user flows work as expected
   - Ensure data is correctly displayed

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test communication between services
   - Verify data integrity between frontend and backend

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Ensure graceful degradation

4. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Test scheduler monitoring system
   - Verify metrics collection and display
   - Validate system status indicators

## How to Use

1. **Setup Test Environment**:

   ```bash
   ./setup_integration_test.sh
   ```

2. **Start Components for Testing**:

   ```bash
   ./start_integration_test.sh
   ```

3. **Execute Test Plan**:
   Follow the test scenarios outlined in `test_plan.md` and track progress using the `integration_checklist.md`.

4. **Analyze Results**:
   Document any issues found during testing and prioritize fixes based on severity.

## Recent Updates

### Scheduler Monitoring System Integration

We have implemented a comprehensive monitoring system for the scheduler service, consisting of:

1. **SchedulerMonitor Component** (`frontend/src/components/SchedulerMonitor.tsx`)
   - Real-time display of scheduler system status
   - Queue metrics visualization (active jobs, queue size, worker count)
   - System load indicators with color-coded status
   - Active job cards with progress tracking
   - Auto-refresh functionality for live updates

2. **Dashboard Integration** (`frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)
   - Enhanced Dashboard with scheduler monitoring integration
   - Display of recent schedule generations
   - System-wide statistics presentation
   - Responsive layout using modern Material UI v7 patterns

3. **Documentation** (`docs/scheduler-monitoring.md`)
   - Detailed explanation of the monitoring system
   - Component structure and responsibilities
   - API integration points
   - Status states and monitoring capabilities
   - Future enhancement possibilities

### Benefits of the Monitoring System

1. **Operational Visibility**
   - Administrators can see the current state of the scheduler system at a glance
   - Real-time tracking of job progress and system load

2. **Resource Management**
   - Early identification of system bottlenecks
   - Worker utilization visibility

3. **Job Management**
   - Tracking of individual job status and progress
   - Ability to cancel in-progress jobs when needed

4. **User Experience**
   - Clear feedback on submitted job status
   - Transparency in the scheduling process

### Technical Implementation

The monitoring system uses a combination of:
- React state management for UI updates
- Polling mechanism for real-time data
- Color-coded visual indicators for status representation
- Responsive grid layouts for various screen sizes
- Integration with the SchedulerService API

This integration significantly improves the operational capabilities of the system by providing administrators with the tools they need to monitor and manage the scheduling process effectively.

## Next Steps

1. Fix any issues found during testing
2. Consider implementing the improvements suggested in the analysis document
3. Complete the remaining frontend components
4. Enhance ApprovalWorkflow with notification system
   - Email notifications for status changes
   - In-app notifications for stakeholders
5. Implement role-based permission testing for ApprovalWorkflow
6. ✅ Add unit tests for ApprovalWorkflow component
7. ✅ Implement scheduler monitoring system
8. Add comprehensive unit tests for other integrated components
9. Prepare for production deployment
